#2) BONUS: When are teams eliminated from playoff contention? Using the results for the 2016-17 regular season as a test case for your quantitative solution, please generate the date that each team was eliminated from playoff contention. We are purely looking for a date when a team was eliminated from playoff consideration, not any specific seed. Please note that your solution should generate the dates automatically, and should use code-based or Excel-based tools. To aid your work, click on this LINK for a .pdf file of the NBA Tiebreaker rules and an .xlsx file with the following three tabs 1) Divisions for the 2016-17 Season, 2) The game results for the 2016-17 NBA Regular Season, 3) A sample that includes the correct formatting for your final submission. Please note that teams that qualified for the playoffs should be labeled "Playoffs" and the date a team is eliminated should be reported in text format, not Excel Date format.

Run the test.py file to see a list of team names, win counts, and win percentages determine which teams are eliminated from the playoff race. 

python test.py 

Run the elimination_algorithm.py file to see a list of teams that are eliminated from the playoffs and the date that they were eliminated. 

python elimination_algorithm.py

Must run in Python2.7 environment due to some built-in libraries being used.
